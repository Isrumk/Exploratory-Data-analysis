# Exploratory-Data-analysis

In this notebook I sought to experiment EDA using Pandas profiling function.
The data I used is based on wash and food security project baseline survey in one of the counties in Kenya.
The  project is largely focusing on preparing and building the capacity of communities
to enable them to absorb, adapt and transform their lives in the face of climate change.
From the above output we can see how Pandas profiling function can be used to quickly skim data before indepth analysis.It displays interesting insights which often takes time to generate in SPSS
